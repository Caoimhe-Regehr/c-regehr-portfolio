		<p id="bio">I am a Canadian graphic designer working predominantly with created and taken imagery. I started doing art and making pieces that fit within the graphic design field when I was 6 years old, and started trying to do basic videography. By the end of elementary school, I was using photoshop and blender to create sprites and 3D assets for my animations. Starting in high school/secondary school, I took a few art classes, most of which were related to digital art and imaging. I also studied more traditional art styles in another class, and applied to St Clair at the end of 2022. Since then, outside of the graphic design program, I have also studied optics, VFX, and animation through the use of internet resources and second-hand textbooks.<br><br>The main inspirations for my art is film, TV serials, cartoons, and various illustrations from various historical periods. Among these are TRON, The Matrix, Batman the Animated Series, Justice League Unlimited, and the work of Christopher Tolkein, and Bryan Lee O'Malley.<br><br>When not working on designs and images, I am either doing photography, watching Lord of the Rings, or playing something from my video game backlog.
